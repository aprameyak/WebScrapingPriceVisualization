## üìå What it Does  

The **Price Scraper & Trend Analyzer** program scrapes product price data from two different products using **BeautifulSoup**. The scraped price data is stored in a **CSV file** and read into a **Pandas dataframe** for analysis. The price trends of the two products are visualized using **Matplotlib**, helping users compare price fluctuations over time.

## üöÄ How We Built It  

### Technologies Used:  
- **Python**: A versatile programming language used for web scraping, data manipulation, and visualization.  
- **BeautifulSoup**: A Python library used for parsing HTML and scraping product prices from e-commerce websites.  
- **Pandas**: A data analysis library that allows for easy manipulation of tabular data and CSV file handling.  
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used for visualizing the price trends of the products over time.

### Web Scraping:  
- **BeautifulSoup**: Extracts the price data of two different products by parsing HTML from the e-commerce pages.  
- **CSV File Output**: The scraped prices are written into a CSV file for future analysis.

### Data Visualization:  
- **Pandas DataFrame**: Reads the CSV file and structures the data for easy analysis and plotting.  
- **Data Plotting**: **Matplotlib** is used to plot the prices of the two products over time, allowing for trend analysis and comparison.

## üöÄ Features  

- **Web Scraping**: Scrapes product prices from e-commerce websites using **BeautifulSoup**.  
- **CSV File Output**: Stores the scraped prices in a CSV file to be used for future analysis.  
- **Data Analysis**: Uses **Pandas** to load the data from the CSV file and structure it for visualization.
